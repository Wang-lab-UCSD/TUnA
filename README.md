# TUnA: Transformer with Uncertainty Awareness for PPI Prediction


## Introduction


## Environment
    Python 3.10.12
    PyTorch 1.13.1
    Numpy 1.23.5
    Keras 2.2.4

## Usage
### Retraining and reproducing results
To reproduce the results, first we will construct the train/val/test datasets using the Gold Standard dataset created by Bernett et al. 
### Making predictions for any PPIs of interest
